# Semiparametric g computation

This repository provides code to implement semiparametric generalized computation on an example dataset, as described in [publication details to be added here].

The data used here are a corrupted version of the public-use ACTG 320 trial dataset, which has been altered to induce confounding by baseline CD4 cell count.
