# Semiparametric g computation

This repository provides code to implement semiparametric generalized computation on an example dataset, as described in Edwards JK, Cole SR, Zivich PN, Hudgens MG, Breger TL, Shook-Sa BE. Semiparametric g-computation for survival outcomes with time-fixed exposures: an illustration. Annals of Epidemiology. 2024 Jun 3.

The data used here are a corrupted version of the public-use ACTG 320 trial dataset, which has been altered to induce confounding by baseline CD4 cell count.
